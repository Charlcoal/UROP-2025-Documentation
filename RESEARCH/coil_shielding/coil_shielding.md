# Coil Shielding

The coil shielding was simulated using
[Finite Element Method Magnetics](https://www.femm.info/wiki/HomePage).
The relevant FEM file is included, as well
as 2 screenshots of the coil I am using
in my prototype simulated with and without
shielding. I used 0.02" iron for the simulation,
which resulted in significant reduction in the
magnetic field outside of the shielding, and
a small increase to the fielding within the coil.
