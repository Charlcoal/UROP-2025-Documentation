[coil_mag_interaction_distance.md](coil_mag_interaction_distance.md)
contains data on the interaction between coils
and the magnet at various distances.

[initial_half_bridge_testing](initial_half_bridge_testing/)
contains the results of prototyping with the
MP6527 Half-Bridge Driver IC, which did not
end with ideal results.

[coil_shielding](coil_shielding/)
contains a quick look into the effectiveness
of shielding the magnets from adjacent pins.

[current_sensing](current_sensing/)
contains development of a working in-line current
sensor, and the resulting current with/without
a magnet present.
