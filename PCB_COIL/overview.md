# Overview of PCB Coil Research

Coiltest is a folder containing the KiCad files for the test board I printed.
testing.md contains the results of testing this board.

Overall, the strength of interaction between the coils and the magnets was
weak compared to the interaction between the magnets and each other.
I was not confident in the feasibility of creating a pin display using
pcb coils because of this, and switched design towards more "traditional"
electromagnetic coils.
