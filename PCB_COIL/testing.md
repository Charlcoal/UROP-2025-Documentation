### Holding Amperage

The tests were performed by dropping an axial N52 magnet down an aluminum tube,
which was positioned in the center of the pcb coil being tested. The eddy currents
in the aluminum tube would slow the magnet's descent to a consistent (slow) speed.
This was repeated with increasing current through the coil, until the magnet did
not drop completely through the tube. Then current was then recorded.

### Resistance

A standard multimeter was used to find the coil resistance, with compensation for
contact resistance.

### Other Values

All other values have been calculated from the measured values and descriptions
of the coils.
