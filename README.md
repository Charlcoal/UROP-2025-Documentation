# Future Shape Display Mechanisms

This project is investigating the potential of using solenoid
coils to directly drive pins of a shape display,
specifically one that updates in real time (~20Hz) with
~8 bits of distinguishable position. Ideally, it would also
be able to sense force applied to the tops of the pins.

## Sections

**LOG** contains a continuous log of the project research, which is
not condensed.  
**PCB_COIL** contains initial research on the possibility of
printing coils on circuit, which did not get far.
