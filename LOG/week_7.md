# Week 7

## 15 July 2025

Today I am printing another iteration of the pin sleeve ([Rev3](../Cad_Files/PinSleeve-Rev3.amf)).
I am adjusting the fit to not stick (slightly larger inner diameter)
and increasing the depth of the coil slots to accommodate 300 turns
properly. I am also creating a slot for the magnet to sit within
thin pin itself. In order to do this, I am adjusting the shape of
the inner hole to allow for more support around the magnet, which
pushes up the outer diameter to 0.22".

I am also getting around to starting this log, which means this
marks the first non-backfilled entry in this repository.
